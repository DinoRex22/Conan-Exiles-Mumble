# Conan-Exiles-Mumble

# I invite you to carefully read the [LICENSE](LICENSE) before any use.

Hello,
I am pleased to present my completed project: a Mumble plugin for Conan Exiles. Although some planned features were abandoned, the plugin remains fully functional and perfectly usable for servers; you just need to reactivate and configure them. I have made sure to comment my code as much as possible in English. Some of the text in the plugin.c file is temporarily translated into French but will be retranslated into English soon. Feel free to share your feedback, improvement suggestions, or modifications that could be relevant.
